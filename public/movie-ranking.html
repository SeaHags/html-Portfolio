<h1>The Best Shows for my Toddler...that I enjoy as well</h1>
<h2> My top 3 favorites:</h2>
<hr />

<h3> Peppa Pig </h3>
<p> Peppa pig is not only adorable, it is visually pleasing and calming.</p>

<h3> The Tiny Chef Show</h3>
<p> Both my 2 year old and I <i>LOVE</i> this stop motion animation that follows a little chef that lives in a stump.</p>

<h3> Sesame Street</h3>
<p> I swear my 2 year old daughter is smarter because of this show. I may also have gained some knowledge as well!</p>
